  	<p><strong>To FMIS Users:</strong></p>


<p>"Please log-off or do not attempt  to log-on to the FMIS-ADS website at 4:00 PM EST.  We will be updating the FMIS-ADS system with new TIRES frames.  You will be able to log back on at 5:00 pm EST. Thank you."</p>
  	
<!--
<p> 
		Because security updates for the older operating systems are no longer being developed and released, 
		we will not be able to support FMIS for the older Windows 95/98/NT4/ME operating systems.
	</p>
	<p>  
		The phase-out period is six months; therefore, FMIS with option for Windows 95/98/NT4/ME WILL NOT be available starting 
		June 30, 2005.
