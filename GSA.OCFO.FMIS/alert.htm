<p><strong><font color="red"><u>Update - August 25, 2008</u></font></strong></p>
<P>The FMIS database has been successfully migrated to its new location in Phoenix, Arizona.  All VATs have been loaded up to this morning (VAT 237) and all VAT related tables are also updated.  We have also confirmed that both FMIS Citrix application and database are available.  You, now, can resume with your ETLs and queries.  If you have any process that was interrupted during August 22 and 24, you may need to verify data and reload.</p>

<p>We thank you for your patience and cooperation in this migration.</p>

<p> - FMIS Team.</p>
